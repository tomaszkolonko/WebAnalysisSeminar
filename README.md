## Prerequisites

R is used for the the correlation and multiple linear regression part. Cleaning of the Data and parsing the STATUS and DATE fields are also done with R.

Matlab is used for the machine learning part.

Download and install R from: https://cran.r-project.org/

Download and install Matlab from: https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html

The MyPersonality Dataset can be downlaoded from: http://mypersonality.org/wiki/doku.php?id=download_databases

## Configuration

Open the R-scripts inside R or RStudio and you should be able to run them immediately.

## Goal for this project

Find meaningful correlations within the dataset, extract new information from existing variables (e.g. parse date and add from it new predictors: "month" and "timeOfDa". Try to predict Big5 personality traits with machine learning from given data set. Discussion of shortcomings of the data set and how to improve it for further research.
