Predicting Extrovertion from network properties:

Median linear regression cost per sample: 0.676667
Median SVM Accuracy on test set using RBF kernel: 65.831258

AGR from network:

Median linear regression cost per sample: 0.475980
Median SVM Accuracy on test set using RBF kernel: 56.097561

NETWORKSIZE ~ sEXT + sCON:
Median linear regression cost per sample: 86324.685156
Not very successful, since there is a big variation in the possible network size values.

DENSITY ~ sEXT + sCON + sOPN:
no meaningful result from which we could draw a conclusion

nBrokerage ~Big Five:
pretty good results, but not very meaningful. The network properties have a very high variance and a high value range. Also, we cannot apply SVM to that.
